So this debate of water being a human right is pretty relevant in the Detroit area, because half the people are like ""wtf! I've been paying for treated water and so should everyone."" and the other half are like ""don't turn off our water, we shouldn't have to pay for it. It is a human right!""

The arguments against it seem flimsy because of what you've stated. It boils down, in my opinion, to more of a partisan bickering match where each side is saying the other side is trying to cheat the system by allowing or not allowing voter ID laws. The Republicans say Democrats are cheating in elections currently, therefore we need voter ID laws in place. The Democrats say the Republicans will get an unfair advantage with voter ID laws because a lot of the people who typically vote Democrat might not have photo ID, or even be able to get them, before the election.

It also degrades VERY rapidly when exposed to air and sunlight. That said, it can be pretty hazardous in immediate run-off, and it's usually mixed with surfactants and carrier solutions that are potentially more environmentally detrimental.
