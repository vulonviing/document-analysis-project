The arguments against it seem flimsy because of what you've stated. It boils down, in my opinion, to more of a partisan bickering match where each side is saying the other side is trying to cheat the system by allowing or not allowing voter ID laws. The Republicans say Democrats are cheating in elections currently, therefore we need voter ID laws in place. The Democrats say the Republicans will get an unfair advantage with voter ID laws because a lot of the people who typically vote Democrat might not have photo ID, or even be able to get them, before the election.

The Moon orbits the Earth, but it is gravitationally attractive enough (because of its comparatively large size to the the Earth) to slightly tug the Earth out of its orbit around the Sun back and forth while the Moon moves around it. This is the same effect that we use to discover planets orbiting other stars, as they 'tug' that star back and forth. Thus, the Earth very slightly 'orbits' in place as the Moon moves around it. Now take the same situation but make it more pronounced. Both planets share an orbit trajectory around their star, but are literally moving around each other, tugging on each others orbit around their star.

It also degrades VERY rapidly when exposed to air and sunlight. That said, it can be pretty hazardous in immediate run-off, and it's usually mixed with surfactants and carrier solutions that are potentially more environmentally detrimental.
